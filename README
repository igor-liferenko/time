The microcontroller is ATmega32U4
Check fuses via avrdude -c usbasp -p m32u4
Set fuses on new arduino via avrdude -c usbasp -p m32u4 -U efuse:w:0xcb:m -U hfuse:w:0xd9:m -U lfuse:w:0xff:m

If two or 3 USB devices are used, in order that they will be named properly, insert
them to different ports one by one until two conditions are met:

1.
  ttyACM0 belongs to device showing mm:hh
  ttyACM1 belongs to device showing :ss
  ttyACM2 belongs to gps device

2.
  in the output of the following command bus number for ttyACM0 is the smallest
  and for ttyACM2 is the greatest

    ls -l /sys/class/tty/ttyACM*

NOTE: on raspberry pi the sequence of ports is:

+---+ +---+
| A | | C |
+---+ +---+
+---+ +---+
| B | | D |
+---+ +---+

Connect programmator as:

( ) (G) (O) (.) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (B) (G) (V) (.)

(G) = Gray
(O) = Orange
(B) = Brown
(V) = Violet
( ) = no pin
(.) = unused pin

Connect display as:

Display: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)
Arduino: ( ) (4) (.) (5) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (1) (.) (3) (2)

-------------------------

In ConnectBot add entry to show/hide seconds using this for "run on connect":

    if [ -e /tmp/time.no-seconds ]; then clock seconds; else clock no-seconds; fi; exit
    <empty line>

and enable "close when connection disappears"

---------------------

Post-install script of ntpd package deletes /usr/sbin/ntpd
(this effectively turns /etc/init.d/sysntpd into a no-op).
Post-remove script of ntpd package restores /usr/sbin/ntpd
(/usr/sbin/ntpd is symlink to busybox).
