If two or 3 USB devices are used, in order that they will be named properly, insert
them to different ports one by one until two conditions are met:

1.
  ttyACM0 belongs to device showing mm:hh
  ttyACM1 belongs to device showing :ss
  ttyACM2 belongs to gps device

2.
  in the output of the following command bus number for ttyACM0 is the smallest
  and for ttyACM2 is the greatest 

    ls -l /sys/class/tty/ttyACM*  

NOTE: on raspberry pi the sequence of ports is:

+---+ +---+
| A | | C |
+---+ +---+
+---+ +---+
| B | | D |
+---+ +---+

(G) = Gray
(O) = Orange
