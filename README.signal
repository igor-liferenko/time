time-write.signal and write-seconds.signal
are for firmware created using brightness.ch

-----------------------

I don't know if core dump is made and to be sure that flash memory
is not filled I use only signals which are Term (not Core). (Because
a signal may arrive before its signal handler is installed.)

SIGKILL cannot have handler. SIGTERM is used for termination.
SIGALRM must not be used together with sleep().
