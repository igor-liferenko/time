do big panel on 'c' and delete comments about ports from build-c.sh and change ttyACM2 to ttyACM1 in two places of build-c.sh and delete seconds.ch and time-write.ch and rename files with capital letters and
re-do time-write as shell script because time-write.ch will not be used
---------
move "if (time[0] == 'A') {" part from time.w to change-file
---------
check /proc/<pid of time-write>/stat - 7th field must be 0 (controlling terminal - man 5 proc)
