On 10.0.0.12 right after reboot try

  ntpq -c cv|grep 'timecode="'

and

  ntpq -p | grep '^\*'

and depending on result, use first in rc.local and second in cron.
On 10.0.0.11 do the same, and if not works (due to absence of ntpd
package) - try both `ntpdate -d 10.0.0.12' and `ntpdate -q' in
each case.
