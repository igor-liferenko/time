use d40- as event for configuring EP0 and get rid of ISR?
----------
try deleting ep1 (and changing ep2 into ep1), not forgetting to change
 
    2, /* two endpoints (IN and OUT) */

to

    1, /* one endpoint (OUT) */
---------
git reset --hard f18f77c0b70bd3b49da450db49e3b128b01f66f7
and in @<Initialize Configuration header descriptor@> change
"2, @/" to "3, @/"
Will two ttyACM devices appear?
---------
Re-do time-write as shell script (this is useful if you generate image online where there is no SDK).
---------
Ensure that time-write does not have controlling terminal - the output of this command must be 0:

    cut -d' ' -f7 </proc/`pgrep time-write`/stat
