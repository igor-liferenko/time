On 10.0.0.12 in rc.local run daemon that starts timer for 2 seconds, opens gpspipe -r and reads from it and when it
reads end of NMEA string, it calls alarm(0) and does this:
if (blinking == 1) system("killall -USR2 time-write"); // stop blinking
blinking = 0;

SIGALRM handler does this:
if (blinking == 0) system("killall -USR1 time-write"); // start blinking
blinking = 1;

(Use global variable `volatile int blinking;'.)
